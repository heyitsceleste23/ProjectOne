                            <h3>Celeste Tran is currently a second year student at San Francisco State University, majoring in Visual Communication Design. She loves everything to do with music, fashion, hanging out with her friends and loved ones, and her Boston Terrier, Wondo. She’s from San Jose, CA, and transferred into SFSU my second year of college, after attending Cal State Monterey Bay for a year. During her first semester at CSUMB, she realized the campus was not where she belonged and decided to transfer into SFSU instead. Since the fall semester began, she soon realized that San Francisco is way more welcoming & feels more like her home away from home that Monterey never gave me. One of her favorite hobbies is video editing with an Adobe program called After Effects in my free time, and I’ve been editing since 2020. Video editing is one of the only things that calms her nerves when she’s overwhelmed and she loves that she can be creative in such a unique way. It's one of the things that brought her and her long distance best friend, Ayla together, and Celeste truly couldn't live her life without Ayla. Being able to bond over this hobby with her best friend is something she keeps close to her heart. She loves and is always listening and talking about music, and wrote a little bit about them on my inspiration & top fives :) Her favorite artists are One Direction, Billie Eilish, Role Model and Harry Styles, but she loves discovering other small artists as well. Another thing she loves being creative with is photography, and she loves collecting and taking photos with my digital cameras. She’s super interested in film photography as well but it’s super expensive so she’s sticking to just digital cameras right now! Celeste wanted to keep my future career separate from her video editing hobby, so that when times do get sort of rough, overwhelming and chaotic there's still something for her to fall back on for comfort and creativity since it’s one of the only things that she’s passionate about other than design and spending time with her loved ones! It was nice meeting you, thank you for stopping by :)</h2>
